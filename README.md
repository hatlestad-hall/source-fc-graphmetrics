# source-fc-graphmetrics
This repository contains MATLAB code used for the calculation of graph metrics and statistics in Hatlestad-Hall et al., 2021: *Source-level EEG and graph theory reveal widespread functional network alterations in focal epilepsy* (OpenAccess: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2021.04.008>).



The code is provided "as is", in the hope that it will be of use for readers of the above paper. Please consider citing the paper if the code is used extensively for publications in a scientific context.



Please bear in mind that the code is not organised for generic use. Re-use will require some know-how; however, feel free to use whatever part of the code that is of interest. A sample functional connectivity file and a sample graph metrics file are provided under "sample data", to give a clue about the data structure.



The calculation of graph metrics require the Brain Connectivity Toolbox, available from <https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/>.
